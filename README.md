News API

This project consists of a back-end API for a news system similar to Reddit, where users can post articles on different topics. The users can also post comments on the articles. Articles and topics can receive positive and negative votes from users, depending on whether they liked the content or not.
The project was created with JavaScript (Node.js) and an Express.js server.
The project was done entirely with test-driven development, using Jest and Supertest.
The database was implemented with PostgreSQL, and the entire project was modeled following the MVC design pattern.



Setup instructions:

The project uses two different databases for different purposes:

Test database: used during the testing phase.
Dev database: used during development phase.
Important

You need to create two different .env files to setup the databases as follows:
.env.development - Uses the development database, set the variable PGDATABASE to the correct database (PGDATABASE=database_name_here)

.env.test - Uses the test database, set the variable PGDATABASE to the correct database (PGDATABASE=database_name_here)

Please refer to db/setup.sql file for the correct database names, and also to create the databases locally;

To install the databases: - npm run setup-dbs on your terminal.

To seed the databases: - npm run seed

To install the project dependencies: - npm install

To run the project tests: - npm run test
